# techincal-documentation
This documentation manual follows the turn structure in a game of Magic and is optimized to work on mobile devices. Project made for a freeCodeCamp.org course.

Some of the ids and classes follow the structure required by the original freeCodeCamp project for the Responsive Web Design certification. For example, the code sections are not necessary for the actual document.

However for the sake of simplicity I decided to keep most of these requirements and also ended up liking the visual element of the code sections.

A media query was included to modify the layout of the page when working in devices with a screen of 600px.
